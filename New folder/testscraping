webmasters hello google search central wednesday november 11 2020 the history behind google webmasters merriam webster claims the first known use of the word webmaster was in 1993 years before google even existed however the term is becoming archaic and according to the data found in books its use is in sharp decline a user experience study we ran revealed that very few web professionals identify themselves as webmasters anymore they re more likely to call themselves search engine optimizer seo online marketer blogger web developer or site owner but very few webmasters we re changing our name in brainstorming our new name we realized that there s not one term that perfectly summarizes the work people do on websites to focus more on the topic that we talk about google search we re changing our name from google webmasters central to google search central both on our websites and on social media our goal is still the same we aim to help people improve the visibility of their website on google search the change will happen on most platforms in the next couple days centralizing help information to one site to help people learn how to improve their website s visibility on google search we re also consolidating our help documentation and blogs to one site moving forward the search console help center will contain only documentation related to using search console it s also still the home of our help forum newly renamed from webmasters help community to google search central community the information related to how google search works crawling and indexing search guidelines and other search related topics are moving to our new site which previously focused only on web developer documentation the content move will happen over the next few days we will continue to create content for anyone who wants their websites to show up on google search whether you re just getting started with seo or you re an experienced web professional consolidating the blogs the blog that you re reading right now is also moving to our main site however we will wait one week to allow subscribers to read this last post on the old platform moving this blog including our other 13 localized

googlebot mascot gets a refresh our googlebot mascot is also getting an upgrade googlebot s days of wandering the web solo come to a close as a new sidekick joins googlebot in crawling the internet when we first met this curious critter we wondered is it really a spider after some observation we noticed this spider bot hybrid can jump great distances and sees best when surrounded by green light we think googlebot s new best friend is a spider from the genus phidippus though it seems to also have bot like characteristics googlebot s been trying out new nicknames for the little spider bot but they haven t settled on anything yet maybe you can help as parting words update your bookmarks and if you have any questions or comments you can find us on twitter and in our google search central help community posted by lizzi harvey technical writer on the google search central team google timing for bringing page experience to google search tuesday november 10 2020 this past may we announced that page experience signals would be included in google search ranking these signals measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a web page and contribute to our ongoing work to ensure people get the most helpful and enjoyable experiences from the web in the past several months we ve seen a median 70 increase in the number of users engaging with lighthouse and page speed insights and many site owners using search console s core web vitals report to identify opportunities for improvement today we re announcing that the page experience signals in ranking will roll out in may 2021 the new page experience signals combine core web vitals with our existing search signals including mobile friendliness safe browsing https security and intrusive interstitial guidelines the change for non amp content to become eligible to appear in the mobile top stories feature in search will also roll out in may 2021 any page that meets the google news content policies will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience whether implemented using amp or any other web technology as we rank the results in addition to the timing updates described above we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience a new way of highlighting great experiences in google search we believe that providing information about the quality of a web page s experience can be helpful to users in choosing the search result that they want to visit on results the snippet or image preview helps provide topical context for users to know what information a page can provide visual indicators on the results are another way to do the same and we are working on one that identifies pages that have met all of the page experience criteria we plan to test this soon and if the testing is successful it will launch in may 2021 and we ll share more details on the progress of this in the coming months the tools publishers need for improving page experience to get ready for these changes we have released a variety of tools that publishers can use to start improving their page experience the first step is doing a site wide audit of your pages to see where there is room for improvement search console s report for core web vitals gives you an overview of how your site is doing and a deepdive into issues once you ve identified opportunities page speed insights and lighthouse can help you as you iterate on fixing any issues that you ve uncovered head over to web dev vitals tools for a roundup of all the tools you need to get started additionally amp is one of the easiest and cost effective ways for publishers looking to achieve great page experience outcomes based on the analysis that the amp team has done the majority of the amp pages achieve great page experiences if you re an amp publisher check out the recently launched amp page experience guide a diagnostic tool that provides developers with actionable advice we continue to support amp content in google search if you publish an amp version of your content google search will link to that cache optimized amp version to help optimize delivery to users just as is the case today conclusion at google search our mission is to help users find the most relevant and quality sites on the web the goal with these updates is to highlight the best experiences and ensure that users can find the information they re looking for our work is ongoing which is why we plan to incorporate more page experience signals going forward and
